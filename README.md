# Introduction

[This digital garden](https://calculus-uc3m.netlify.app/) contains the notes for the course of Calculus for Robotics Engineering at the UC3M taught by [me](https://floriomciaglia.wordpress.com/) in the academic year 2023/2024.

The notes are written using [Obsidian for Linux](https://obsidian.md/) and deployed through [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) by means of the [beautiful plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden) by [oleeskild](https://github.com/oleeskild) (docs for the plugin are available at [dg-docs.ole.dev](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/)).

Please, notify me about comments/remarks/mistakes/questions by creating an issue in this repository, or sending me an email using my institutional address (which coincides with the address on the latest entry of my [arXiv page](https://arxiv.org/search/?searchtype=author&query=Ciaglia%2C+F+M)).
