# Power series

Once we understand that it is possible to make sense of the sum of infinite numbers using numerical series, nothing prevents us in trying to develop similar ideas for the sum of an infinite number of functions. In particular, we will only focus our attention on the so-called **power series**.

>[!defn] Definition: power series
>A power series is a series whose elements are polynomial functions:
>$$
>P(x,a)=\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} \;a_{n}\,(x-a)^{n}
>$$
>where $x,a\in\mathbb{R}$ and $\{a_{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is a numerical sequence.

Essentially, for any fixed choice of $x,a\in \mathbb{R}$, we obtain a numerical series. However, since $x$ may vary, it makes sense to look at $P(x,a)$ as a kind of function (depending on the parameter $a$). This point of view turns out to be particularly useful because it leads to the introduction of new interesting functions.

We use the  [[1.4 Sequences and series#^3a9a60\|root test]] to obtain that the power series $P(x,a)$ is [[1.4 Sequences and series#^32251b\|absolutely convergent]] if

$$
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\sqrt[n]{|a_{n}|\,|(x-a)^{n}|}=|x-a|\,\left(\lim_{n\rightarrow + \infty} \sqrt[n]{|a_{n}|}\right) < 1 .
$$

The case where the limit is $1$ must be handled with a case-by-case analysis.

The extended real number $\rho\geq 0$ given by

$$
\frac{1}{\rho}:=\lim_{n\rightarrow +\infty} \sqrt[n]{|a_{n}|}
$$

is then called the **convergence radius** of the power series because, when the power series is absolutely convergent, then $|x-a|< \rho$.

If a power series converges in $I=(a-\rho, a+\rho)$ then we can define the scalar function

$$
f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}a_{n}\,(x-a)^{n}
$$

for every $x\in I$. Unless $a_{n}=0$ for every $n>N$ with $N$ fixed, the scalar function defined above is a kind of **trascendental function** (we can not compute its value at $x$ using only algebraic operations).

Functions defined through a power series enjoy a lot of interesting properties.

>[!important] Proposition
>Consider the function $f(x)$ defined through the power series

>f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}a_{n}\,(x-a)^{n}

>converging in some open interval $I=(a-\rho,a+\rho)$. This function has then infinitely many continuous derivatives in $I$ given by
>$$
>f^{(k)}(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}\frac{\mathrm{d}^{k}}{\mathrm{d}x^{k}}\,\left(a_{n}\,(x-a)^{n}\right).
>$$
>In particular, any such function $f$ is continuous.

# The exponential and logarithm functions

The convergence radius of the power series
$$
E(x,a)=\sum\limits_{k=0}^{+\infty} \frac{(x-a)^{k}}{k!}
$$
satisfies
$$
\frac{1}{\rho}=\lim_{k\rightarrow+\infty}\frac{|x-a|}{\sqrt[k]{k!}} =0,
$$
which means that the power series converges for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$.  The (infinitely differentiable) function defined by $E(x,0)$ is called the exponential function and denoted by
$$
\mathrm{exp}(x):=E(x,0)=\sum\limits_{k=0}^{+\infty} \frac{x^{k}}{k!}.
$$
The value $\mathrm{exp}(1)$ is called the **Euler number**, and it is denoted by $\mathrm{e}$. It is also customary to write $\mathrm{e}^{x}\equiv\mathrm{exp}(x)$.

>[!important] Proposition: the exponential function
>The exponential function $\mathrm{exp}\colon \mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ satisfies the following properties:
>1) $\mathrm{exp}(x)>0$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$;
>2) $\mathrm{exp}(x)'=\mathrm{exp}(x)$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$;
>3) $\mathrm{exp}(a+b)=\mathrm{exp}(a)\,\mathrm{exp}(b)$ for all $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ (in particular, $\mathrm{exp}(0)=1$, and $\mathrm{exp}(-x)=(\mathrm{exp}(x))^{-1}$).
>4) it is bijective (injective and surjective);
>5) $\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}\,\mathrm{exp}(x)=+\infty$;
>6)  $\lim_{x\rightarrow-\infty}\,\mathrm{exp}(x)=0$.

Because of property 3 of the exponential function, we have
$$
E(x,a)=\mathrm{exp}(x-a)=\mathrm{exp}(x)\,\mathrm{exp}(-a),
$$
which means that $\mathrm{exp}(x)$ is all we really need to discuss all the functions of the form $E(x,a)$.

>[!important] Proposition: the logarithm function
>The inverse function of $\mathrm{exp}(x)\equiv\mathrm{e}^{x}$ is called the **logarithm function** and it is denoted by $\ln(x)$. Since $\mathrm{exp}(x)>0$, the domain of the logarithm function is $(0,\infty)$. The logarithm function satisfies the following properties:
>1) $\ln(x)<0$ for $x\in(0,1)$, $\ln(1)=0$, and $\ln(x)>0$ for $x>1$;
>2) $\ln(ab)=\ln(a) + \ln(b)$ for all $a,b>0$ (in particular, $\ln(x^{n})=n\ln(x)$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$);  
>3) $\ln(\frac{a}{b})=\ln(a)-\ln(b)$ for all $a,b>0$;
>4) $\ln(x)'=\frac{1}{x}$ for all $x>0$ (using the [[1.3 Derivatives of scalar functions#^05d051\|the rule for the derivative of the inverse]]), which means that $\ln(x)$ is infinitely differentiable;
>5) it is (obviously) invertible, and its inverse is (obviously) the exponential function;
>6) $\lim_{x\rightarrow 0^{+}}\,\ln(x)=-\infty$, and $\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}\,f(x)=x$.

Using the exponential and logarithm functions, given $a>0$, we define the function
$$
a^{x}:=\mathrm{e}^{x\ln(a)}.
$$
Clearly, for $a=1$, we obtain a constant function. Moreover, $a^{x}$ is well defined for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$, and $a^{x}>0$ for every $x\in\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, we obtain
$$
\ln(a^{b})=\ln(\mathrm{e}^{b\ln(a)})=b\ln(a), 
$$
which is a sort of generalization of the particular case discussed in property 2 of the logarithm function.

# The trigonometric functions

The radius of convergence of the power series
$$
\begin{split}
S(x)& =\sum\limits_{k=0}^{+\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k}\,(x-a)^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!} \\ & \\
C(x)& =\sum\limits_{k=0}^{+\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k}(x-a)^{2k}}{(2k)!} 
\end{split}
$$
satisfy
$$
\begin{split}
\frac{1}{\rho_{S}} & =\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} \frac{(x-a)^{2}}{\sqrt[k]{(2k+1)!}} = 0  \\ & \\
\frac{1}{\rho_{C}} & =\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} \frac{(x-a)^{2}}{\sqrt[k]{(2k)!}} =0,
\end{split}
$$
which means that both power series converge for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$. We thus obtain two infinitely differentiable functions that are denoted by
$$
\begin{split}
\sin(x) & := \sum\limits_{k=0}^{+\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k}\,(x-a)^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!} \\ & \\
\cos(x) & := \sum\limits_{k=0}^{+\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k}\,(x-a)^{2k}}{(2k)!},
\end{split}
$$
and are referred to as *sine* and *cosine* function, respectively. These functions are the building block of the so-called *trigonometric functions*.

>[!important] Proposition: sine and cosine functions
>The *sine* and *cosine* function defined above satisfy the following properties:
>1) $\sin(x+2k\pi)= \sin(x)$,  $\cos(x)=\cos(x + 2k\pi)$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$, and all $k\in\mathbb{Z}$ (the functions are **periodic** with period $2\pi$);
>2) $\sin(-x)=-\sin(x)$, and $\cos(-x)=\cos(x)$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$;
>3) $\cos(x)=\sin(x + \pi/2)$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$;
>4) $\sin(0)=\sin(\pi)=0$, and $\sin(\pi/2)=1$ (using property 3 we obtain the values of $\cos$ for the same input numbers);
>5) $\sin^{2}(x) + \cos^{2}(x)=1$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$;
>6) $\sin(x)'=\cos(x)$ and $\cos(x)'=-\sin(x)$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$;
>7) the inverse function of $\sin(x)$ is defined for $\frac{-\pi}{2}\leq x\leq \frac{\pi}{2}$ and is denoted as $\arcsin(x)$;
>8) the inverse function of $\cos(x)$ is defined for $0\leq x\leq \pi$ and is denoted as $\arccos(x)$;
>9) both $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$ do not admit limits at $\pm\infty$ because they oscillate.

Starting from $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$, we define the *tangent* and *cotangent* function as
$$
\tan(x):=\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}\,\qquad \cot(x):=\frac{\cos(x)}{\sin(x)}=\frac{1}{\tan(x)},
$$
respectively. Note that both $\tan(x)$ and $\cot(x)$ are not defined on the whole real linea because there are infinitely many points at which $\sin(x)$ or $\cos(x)$ are $0$. Moreover, both $\tan(x)$ and $\cot(x)$ are periodic functions of period $\pi$ (half of $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$).

It turns out that $\tan(x)$ is invertible for $\frac{\pi}{2}\leq x\leq \frac{\pi}{2}$, and its inverse function is denoted by $\arctan(x)$. Similarly, $\cot(x)$ is invertible in $0\leq x\leq \pi$, and its inverse function is denoted by $\mathrm{arccot}(x)$.
