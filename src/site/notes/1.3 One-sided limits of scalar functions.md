>[!rem] Remark

Another useful formulation of the notion of limit is given in terms of right and left limit. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with step-wise defined functions. The intuition behind the notion of right and left limit is that of splitting in two the $(\epsilon,\delta)$-definition given above depending on how $x$ reaches $x_{0}$.

>[!note] Definition ([one-sided limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-sided_limit))
>Consider the function $f\colon D\subseteq \mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and the point $x_{0}\in\mathbb{R}$, and suppose there is $r\in\mathbb{R}$ such that the open interval $I_{x_{0},r}$ is contained in the domain $D$ except possibly for the point $x_{0}$. The **right** limit  
>$$
>\lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0}^{+}} f(x)=l
>$$  
>is defined if for every $\epsilon>0$ there is a  $0< \delta< r$ such that
>$$ 
>d_{x_{0}}(x)=|x-x_{0}|<\delta \Longrightarrow d_{l}(f(x))=|f(x)-l|<\epsilon 
>$$
>with $x_{0}< x$. Similarly, the **left** limit  $$\lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0}^{-}} f(x)=l $$  is defined if for every $\epsilon>0$ there is a  $0< \delta< r$ such that
>$$
>d_{x_{0}}(x)=|x-x_{0}|<\delta \Longrightarrow d_{l}(f(x))=|f(x)-l|<\epsilon
>$$
>with $x<x_{0}$. 

Limits and one-sided limits are related to one another according to the following proposition (whose proof is left as an instructive exercise).

>On the other hand, for $x>0$ we have $| f(x) - 0|= x^{3}$, so that $|f(x) -0|<\epsilon$ whenever  $|x -x_{0}|=|x|<\epsilon^{\frac{1}{3}}$ which means $x<\delta=\epsilon^{\frac{1}{3}}$. 
>Since the right and left limits exist but are different, the result in proposition (1) above implies that the limit for $x\rightarrow 0$ does not exist. 



>[!question] Exercise
>Formulate the notions of left and right continuity in analogy with the notions of left and right limits.



If $f$ is not continuous at $x_{0}\in D$, then it behaves in one of the following four ways:

1. the limit $\lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0}}f(x)$ exists but is different from $f(x_{0})$ (**removable discontinuity**);
2. the right and left limits at $x_{0}$ exist,are finite but are different (**jump discontinuity**);
3. the right and left limits at $x_{0}$ exist but at least one of them is either $+\infty$ or $-\infty$ (**essential discontinuity**);
4. at least one between the left and right limits do not exist.

Every removable discontinuity can be removed by redefining the function at the point of discontinuity. On the other hand, a jumpl discontinuity can never be removed and represent a kind of _pathology_ of the function. The function in [[1.2 Limits of scalar functions\|example (2)]] has a jump discontinuity at $x_{0}=0$ since the right and left limits do not coincide (recall proposition (1) [[1.2 Limits of scalar functions\|here]]).

>[!attention] Remark
>If $x_{0}$ is not in the domain of $f$, then the previous classification  applies, but $x_{0}$ is a **singularity point**. 

Two reasons why continuous functions are tremendously useful in applications are contained in the following theorems.

>[!important] Theorem: [intermediate value theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem)
>If $f$ is continuos in $[a,b]$ and $K$ is any number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then there is at least one point $c\in (a,b)$ such that $f(c)=K$.

>[!important] Theorem ([Extreme value theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_value_theorem))
>If $f$ is continuous in $[a,b]$ then it attains a maximum and minimum value in $[a,b]$.
