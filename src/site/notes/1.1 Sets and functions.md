We assume a basic (intuitive) understanding of concepts like sets and numbers (natural $\mathbb{N}$, integers $\mathbb{Z}$, rational $\mathbb{Q}$, and real $\mathbb{R}$). 

>[!rem] Remark: sets and numbers
>The notion of set is not as innocuous as it may seem. For instance, if not handled with care, it directly leads to [Russel's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox). To avoid these unpleasant instances, deep thinking and sophisticated tools are needed (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(set_theory)) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory)).  Similarly, the notion of number is both subtle and deep, and we will content ourselves with the intuitive notion that most humans attending University have already acquired through experience and instruction (but feel free to ask all the questions you want in class). Take a look at this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number) for an introductory overview on the beauty of numbers. 

For instance, we are willing to think that the following is a reasonable definition of a set.

>[!defn] Definition: set
> A set $A$ is a collection of distinct objects. The set $B$ is a **subset** of the set $A$ if every element of $B$ belongs to $A$. In addition:
> - if $x$ is an element in $S$ we write $x\in S$, otherwise, we write $x\notin S$; 
> - if $B$ is a subset of $A$ and $A\neq B$, we write $B\subset A$ or $A \supset B$, and we write $B\subseteq A$ or $A\supseteq B$ if we do not know whether $A\neq B$ or not.

Sometimes, you are able to list all elements in a set, as it happens with the set $S$ of the best guitar players of all time: 
$$
S= \mbox{ \{Jimi Hendrix, Frank Zappa\}}.
$$

Some other times it is better to describe the elements in a set through a common property (the symbol $|$ means "such that"):

$$
S= \{ x|\,x\mbox{ is a student in UC3M born on February 29th} \}.
$$

>[!rem] Remark: the empty set
> We assume the existence of the [EMPTY SET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20the%20empty%20set,in%20a%20set%20is%20zero) $\emptyset$. The empty set $\emptyset$ is **assumed** to be a subset of every set, and every set $A$ is a subset of itself.

It is possible to operate on sets to obtain other sets:

- **Union**

$$
A\cup B:=\{x|\,x\in A\mbox{ or } x\in B\}\,\Rightarrow A,B\subseteq A\cup B \mbox{ and } A\cup\emptyset = A;
$$
- **Intersection**

$$
A\cap B:=\{x|\,x\in A\mbox{ and } x\in B\}\,\Rightarrow A\cap B\subseteq A,B \mbox{ and } A\cup\emptyset = A;
$$
- **Cartesian product** 

$$
A\times B:=\left\{(x,y)|\,x\in A\mbox{ and } y \in B\right\}.
$$
