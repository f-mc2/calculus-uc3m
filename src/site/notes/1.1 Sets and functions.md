# Sets and numbers

We assume a basic (intuitive) understanding of concepts like sets and numbers (natural $\mathbb{N}$, integers $\mathbb{Z}$, rational $\mathbb{Q}$, and real $\mathbb{R}$). 

>[!rem] Remark: sets and numbers
>The notion of set is not as innocuous as it may seem. For instance, if not handled with care, it directly leads to [Russel's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox). To avoid these unpleasant instances, deep thinking and sophisticated tools are needed (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(set_theory)) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory)).  Similarly, the notion of number is both subtle and deep, and we will content ourselves with the intuitive notion that most humans attending University have already acquired through experience and instruction (but feel free to ask all the questions you want in class). Take a look at this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number) for an introductory overview on the beauty of numbers. 

For instance, we are willing to think that the following is a reasonable definition of a set (even if it is not).

>[!defn] Definition: Set
> A set $A$ is a collection of distinct objects. The set $B$ is a **subset** of the set $A$ if every element of $B$ belongs to $A$. In addition:
> - if $x$ is an element in $S$ we write $x\in S$, otherwise, we write $x\notin S$; 
> - if $B$ is a subset of $A$ and $A\neq B$, we write $B\subset A$ or $A \supset B$, and we write $B\subseteq A$ or $A\supseteq B$ if we do not know whether $A\neq B$ or not.

Sometimes, you are able to list all elements in a set, as it happens with the set $S$ of the best guitar players of all time: 
$$
S= \mbox{ \{Jimi Hendrix, Frank Zappa\}}.
$$

Some other times it is better to describe the elements in a set through a common property (the symbol $|$ means "such that"):

$$
S= \{ x|\,x\mbox{ is a student in UC3M born on February 29th} \}.
$$

>[!rem] Remark: the empty set
> We assume the existence of the [EMPTY SET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20the%20empty%20set,in%20a%20set%20is%20zero) $\emptyset$. The empty set $\emptyset$ is **assumed** to be a subset of every set, and every set $A$ is a subset of itself.

It is possible to operate on sets to obtain other sets:

- **Union**

$$
A\cup B:=\{x|\,x\in A\mbox{ or } x\in B\}\,\Rightarrow A,B\subseteq A\cup B \mbox{ and } A\cup\emptyset = A;
$$
- **Intersection**

$$
A\cap B:=\{x|\,x\in A\mbox{ and } x\in B\}\,\Rightarrow A\cap B\subseteq A,B \mbox{ and } A\cup\emptyset = A;
$$
- **Cartesian product** 

$$
A\times B:=\left\{(x,y)|\,x\in A\mbox{ and } y \in B\right\}.
$$

# Functions 

Given two sets $A$ and $B$, a **function** $f\colon A\rightarrow B$ is a rule that assigns **one and only one** element $f(x)\in B$ to every $x\in A$. Given the function $f\colon A\rightarrow B$ we have that: 

- $A=\mathrm{Dom}(f)$ is called the **domain** (**input space**) of $f$;
- $B$ is called the **codomain** (**output space**) of $f$;
- $\mathrm{ran}(f)\equiv f(A):=\{y\in B\,|\; \exists\,x\in A \mbox{ with } f(x)=y\}$ is called the **range** of $f$;
- $\mathrm{graph}(f):=\{(x,f(x))\,|\;\;x\in A\}$ is called the **graph** of $f$ (and it's a subset of $A\times B$);
- $f$ is called **injective** (or **one-to-one**) if  it satisfies $f(x)\neq f(y)$ for every $x,y\in A$ such that $x\neq y$ ;
- $f$ is called **surjective** (or **onto**) if its range is the whole $B$ ;
- $f$ is called **bijective** if it is both injective and surjective.

## Composition of functions

An incredibly powerful characteristic of functions is that they can be composed, that is, we can apply two functions $f\colon A \rightarrow B$ and $g\colon C\rightarrow D$ sequentially:

$$ x \quad \stackrel{f}{\mapsto}\quad  y=f(x)\quad \stackrel{g}{\mapsto} \quad z=g(y)=g(f(x))\equiv g\circ f (x) $$

The function $g\circ f\colon A\rightarrow D$ is called the composition of $f$ with $g$. Of course, everything makes sense if and only if the domain $C$ of $g$ contains the range $f(A)$  of $f$. In particular, this means that it must hold $B=C$.

Once we know how to compose two functions, we can start composing an arbitrary number of functions, and it is instructive to check that

$$ (f\circ g)\circ h = f\circ (g\circ h) $$

which means that  the composition of functions is associative whenever it makes sense.

## Restriction of functions to subsets

The composition operation $\circ$ allows to rigorously define the operation of **restriction** of a function to a subset. Specifically, if $C$ is a subset of $A$, there is a function $i_{CA}\colon C\rightarrow A$ called the **canonical immersion** of $C$ in $A$, whose action on every $x\in C\subseteq A$ is given by $i_{CA}(x)=x$.

Therefore, given the function $f\colon A\rightarrow B$, we can immediately define the restriction of $f$ to $C\subseteq A$, often denoted by $f|_{C}$, by simply composing $f$ with the canonical immersion $i_{CA}$:

$$ f|_{C}:=f\circ i_{CA}. $$

## Invertible functions

Given the function $f\colon A\rightarrow B$, if there exists a function $g\colon B\rightarrow A$ such that

$$ g\circ f(x) = x $$

for every $x\in A$, then $f$ is called **left-invertible** and  $g$ is called the **left-inverse** of $f$. We can rewrite the previous equation without mentioning $x$ as follows:

$$ g\circ f = \mathrm{id}_{A}, $$

where we introduced the identity function $\mathrm{id}_{A}$ on the set $A$  whose action is trivially $\mathrm{id}_{A}(x)=x$ for every $x\in A$.

Similarly, $f$ is called **right-invertible** if there is a function $g\colon B\rightarrow A$ such that 

$$ f\circ g = \mathrm{id}_{B}, $$
in which case, $g$ is called the **right-inverse** of $f$.

The function $f$ is called **invertible** if it is both left and right-invertible.
