With the $(\epsilon,\delta)$-definition of limit given above it is not possible to capture the behaviour of a function that grows (or degrows) indefinitely. Therefore, we need to introduce a type of **improper** limit.

>[!note] Definition (Unbounded limit)
>Consider the function $f\colon D\subseteq \mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and the point $x_{0}\in\mathbb{R}$. Assume that there is $r\in\mathbb{R}$ such that the open interval $I_{x_{0},r}$ is contained in the domain $D$ except possibly for the point $x_{0}$. We say that 
>$$ \lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0}} f(x)=+\infty 
>$$ 
>if for every $K>0$ there is a  $0< \delta< r$ such that 
>$$
>d_{x_{0}}(x)=|x-x_{0}|<\delta \Longrightarrow f(x)> K.

>Analogously, we say that 
>$$ \lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0}} f(x)=-\infty

Another relevant instance for which we need to introduce yet another notion of **improper** limit is that in which we want to understand what happens when the input variable does **not** approach a finite value but either grows indefinitely, or degrows indefinitely (when possible).

>[!note] Definition (Limit at infinity)
>Let $f\colon D\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be such that there is $a\in\mathbb{R}$ for which $D\cap (a,+\infty)\neq\emptyset$. We say that

Putting together the notion of **unbounded** limit and of **limit at infinity**, we get the following notion of **unbounded limit at infinity**.

>Let $f\colon D\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be such that there is $a\in\mathbb{R}$ for which $D\cap (a,+\infty)\neq\emptyset$. We say that

>$$ 
>if for every $K>0$ there is a  $M>0$ such that 
>$$

>Similarly, we say that 
>$$ \lim_{x\rightarrow +\infty} f(x)=-\infty 
>$$ 
>if for every $K>0$ there is a  $M>0$ such that 
>$$
>x>M \Longrightarrow f(x)< -K.
>$$
>On the other hand, let $f\colon D\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be such that there is $b\in\mathbb{R}$ for which $D\cap (-\infty,b)\neq\emptyset$. We say that
>$$ \lim_{x\rightarrow -\infty} f(x)=-\infty 
>$$ 
>if for every $K>0$ there is a  $M>0$ such that 
>$$
>x<-M \Longrightarrow f(x)<- K.
>$$
>Similarly, we say that
>$$ \lim_{x\rightarrow -\infty} f(x)=+\infty 
>$$ 
>if for every $K>0$ there is a  $M>0$ such that 
>$$
>x<-M \Longrightarrow f(x)>K.
>$$

>[!attention] Remark
>Note that the uniqueness of the limit, when it exists, can also be proved for all types of improper limits given above.
