# Introductory remarks

This digital garden contains the notes for the course of Calculus for Robotics Engineering at the UC3M taught by [me](https://floriomciaglia.wordpress.com/) in the academic year 2023/2024. The course is quite an unusual one because it aims at presenting the content of a Calculus I (~ scalar functions) and a Calculus II (~ multivariable functions) course together in a single course. 

Let me close these introductory remarks by saying that the notes presented here **do not** grant a full understanding of the concepts and ideas discussed in the course. Therefore, it is always better to rely on the bibliographic references suggested, for instance, in the [_Ficha Reina_](https://aplicaciones.uc3m.es/cpa/generaFicha?est=381&plan=478&asig=19080&idioma=2) (see also [[Home#References\|below]]) . Moreover, besides the exercises provided here, it is warmly suggested to try as many exercises as possible from the bibliographic sources mentioned before, from [here](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Problems/CalcI/CalcI.aspx), and [here](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/ProblemsNS/CalcI/CalcI.aspx) (for one-variable functions - Calculus I), and from [here](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Problems/CalcII/CalcII.aspx), and [here](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/ProblemsNS/CalcII/CalcII.aspx) (for multi-variable functions - Calculus II).

## References

The following are the references which I believe provides the basic understanding necessary to pass the exam:

- [Salas, Etgen, Hille - Calculus: One and Several Variables (tenth edition)](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Calculus%3A+One+and+Several+Variables%2C+10th+Edition-p-9780471698043);
- [Marsden, Tromba - Vector Calculus (sixth edition)](https://www.macmillanlearning.com/college/us/product/Vector-Calculus/p/1429215089).

Additional references, for a deeper understanding and an overall better enjoyment of the beautiful subject Calculus is, are:

# Online resources

In this digital era, a lot of useful resources are available out there in the web. Below there is a list of some of these resources I personally use. Of course, you are strongly encouraged to dive the web and find your own personal resources (and perhaps share them).

## Wikipedia (in English)

It is almost impossible not to start this list from [Wikipedia (in English)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). Whenever I encounter something new or I have a little doubt on something I should know, I consult Wikipedia together with the sources and further references it provides. However, I would not recommend to rely on Wikipedia as your primary and sole reference for studying. 

## MATHEMATICS Stack Exchange

A useful website to consult in order to get additional explanations or help with exercises in basically all fields of Mathematics is [MATHEMATICS Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/). However, before asking a question there, make sure to search in the website for questions similar to the one you want to ask. Indeed, chances are that other people have already asked the same question, and they already received good answers you may profit from. Moreover, if asking for help with an exercise, make sure to explain what you did and why you are stucked. That is, always try to solve exercises on your own and then ask for help. Bear in mind that you need to know some [basics of LaTeX](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) to properly write mathematical expressions on [MATHEMATICS Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/).

## Paul's Online Notes

[This amazing website](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/) can be consulted for additional explanations/exercises, as a source of additional studying material, as well as for the simple fact that it is very nice to read. Moreover, among other things, you can find in it some very useful [cheatsheets](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Extras/CheatSheets_Tables.aspx) on algebra, trigonometry, and calculus.

## LibreTexts Mathematics

[This website](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves) contains some textbooks on Mathematics that are completely free to access, contains exercises, and can be freely downloaded!

## Youtube videos

1) In general in your life, you are strongly advised to check [3Blue1Brown's channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown/featured) because it contains beautiful videos explaining different concepts related to mathematics and physics in a clear and concise way, using graphical animations that help conveying the message. In particular, I suggest the playlist [essence of Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown/playlists) for a nice introduction to one-variable calculus.
2) I did not have time to explore in detail [Trefor Bazett's Calculus playlists](https://www.youtube.com/c/DrTreforBazett/playlists), but I think it is another good place to start for having more graphical explanations of the arguments discussed in the course. 

# FOSSEE Animations Mathematics

[This website](https://math.animations.fossee.in/contents/calculus-of-several-variables) provides interesting (open source) visualizations of concepts from multivariable calculus.

## Tools to help with exercises

Sometimes, it could be helpful to check if some limit/derivative/integral we computed is actually correct. At this purpose, you can refer to the following online tools:
  
1) [Here](https://onsolver.com/ ) you can compute derivatives, integrals, limits, sum of series and other things concerning scalar functions of one variable;  
2) [Here](https://www.symbolab.com/solver/calculus-calculator ) you find also the option to deal with multivariable calculus (move the mouse over "Calculus", a window-menu will open and you'll find "multivariable calculus" there) and with local extrema;  
 3) [Here](https://www.wolframalpha.com/widgets/gallery/view.jsp?id=1451afdfe5a25b2a316377c1cd488883) you find Lagrange multipliers.

Of course, if you rely entirely on these computational tools (some of them offer the possibility to pay to get not only the answer but also the procedure), you will learn essentially nothing! Your own active hard work is the only thing that really helps you learning something.
