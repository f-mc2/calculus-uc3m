This digital garden is realized using [Obsidian for Linux](https://obsidian.md/) and deployed through [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) by means of the [beautiful plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden) by [oleeskild](https://github.com/oleeskild). It contains the notes for the course of Calculus for Robotics Engineering at the UC3M taught by [Florio M. Ciaglia](https://floriomciaglia.wordpress.com/) in the academic year 2022/2023.
